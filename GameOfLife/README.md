# Game of Life

This is for CodeEval's challenge. Given the initial state
of a Game of Life grid from a text file, the challenge is 
to output the game state after 10 iterations of the rules. 

CodeEval's sample input in the question is not terminated by a newline,
but it turned out that the actual test problem is. Also, the challenge requires
that you solve for a grid of 100x100 characters. My code will work for any
size of grid. The last line of the grid must absolutely end with a newline
character! Don't say I didn't warn you.

GameOfLifeOneRule.c is the shorter and faster version of the code.  Use that.
