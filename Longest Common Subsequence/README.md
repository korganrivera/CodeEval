#Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, find all the characters that each string have in common, and keep those characters in order.  
I used sequence alignment with this problem; it's basically the same code as the DNA Alignment problem.
Strings must be separated by a semicolon, all lines must end with a newline.  Strings can contain whitespace though. 

For example,

jetfuel;stealbeams
dankmemes;aesthetics
don't have a ; crap attack
